### Disclaimers

+ All location name, address, telephone, and description data was accessed from https://www.florida-backroads-travel.com/florida-tourist-attractions.html
+ Entries were omitted in scenarios where the aforementioned data was missing or inconsistent
+ Data was unaltered except to improve clarity or program functionality.
+ Location type, group size, rating, and price data were generated for purposes of program search functionality. 
+ Location type was assigned algorithmically where "museum" or "park" was present in location name. Remaining entries were manually assigned location types.
+ Location group size was algorithmically assigned based on location type. In instances where location type was "other", group size was manually assigned.
+ Location rating was pseudorandomly assigned to each entry.
+ Location price was algorithmically assigned based on location description and manually checked for accuracy.
